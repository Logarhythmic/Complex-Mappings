A jupyter notebook that visualizes how funcions with complex 
variables change. One figure plots both the unchanged plane and 
the changed plane with a square being drawn on each. An interactive 
is included to manipulate the square's position. The next plots 
countour lines. The final one is a function that will create gif 
files given some instructions on how the square is to move in the 
plane. Examples included.
